# Review Permissions

Audit permission consistency across all layers: AppPermissions vs AppAuthorizationProvider vs [AbpAuthorize] vs Angular/React.

## What It Does

1. **Scans `AppPermissions.cs`** — All defined permission constants
2. **Scans `AppAuthorizationProvider.cs`** — All registered permissions
3. **Scans `[AbpAuthorize]` usages** — All permission references in app services
4. **Scans Angular/React** — All permission pipe/hook usages in frontend

## Checks

| Check | What It Finds |
|-------|---------------|
| Orphaned constants | Constants in `AppPermissions` not registered in `AppAuthorizationProvider` |
| Missing constants | Permissions used in `[AbpAuthorize]` that don't exist in `AppPermissions` |
| Unregistered permissions | Constants that exist but aren't registered |
| Frontend mismatches | Permission strings in Angular/React that don't match any constant value |
| Missing localization | Permission display names without localization keys |

## Output Format
